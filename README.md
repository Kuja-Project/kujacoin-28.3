### Installing Kujacoin

To use Kujacoin, you'll need a way to connect to the network, and a wallet to hold your funds. This software includes those things for you, you can compile it yourself, or you can download the ones that we have compiled for you.

To compile from sourcecode yourself, [click here for build instructions](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/blob/development/COMPILE.md).

### Getting Started Fast

Everyone starts somewhere. If you're new or returning, you'll probably want to get in sync with the network so you can use your funds. Syncing from your own node is faster than syncing from a remote node. Here are some handy links to get you there as soon as possible.

-   **Use checkpoints** - Checkpoints help your node sync faster, *COMING SOON* or *COMING SOON*.
  
Syncing will take time

-   **Backup your keys** - You can generate a wallet right inside the software. 'kujawallet'.
